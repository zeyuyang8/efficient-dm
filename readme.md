# EFFICIENTDM: EFFICIENT QUANTIZATION-AWARE FINE-TUNING OF LOW-BIT DIFFUSION MODELS

This repository provides the implementation for our paper "EFFICIENTDM: Efficient Quantization-Aware Fine-Tuning of Low-Bit Diffusion Models". Our approach introduces a novel method for fine-tuning low-bit diffusion models, focusing on efficiency and performance.

## Getting Started

Follow the step-by-step tutorial to set up EFFICIENTDM.

### Step 1: Setup

Create a virtual environment and install dependencies as specified by LDM.

### Step 2: Download Pretrained Models

Download the pretrained models provided by LDM.

```shell
mkdir -p models/ldm/cin256-v2/
wget -O models/ldm/cin256-v2/model.ckpt https://ommer-lab.com/files/latent-diffusion/nitro/cin/model.ckpt
```

### Step 3: Collect Input Data for Calibration

Gather input data required for model calibration. Remember to modified the ldm/models/diffusion/ddpm.py as indicated in the quant_scripts/collect_input_4_calib.py.

```python
python3 quant_scripts/collect_input_4_calib.py
```

### Step 4: Quantize and Calibrate the Model

We just apply a naive quantization method for model calibration because we will fine-tune it afterwards.

```python
python3 quant_scripts/quantize_ldm_naive.py
```

### Step 5: Convert Quantized Model

Convert the fake quantized model to a packed integer model. Notice the significant reduction in model size.

```python
python3 quant_scripts/save_naive_2_intmodel.py
```

### Step 6: Fine-Tune with EfficientDM

```python
python3 quant_scripts/train_efficientdm.py
```

### Step 7 (Optional): Downsample TALSQ Parameters

Optionally, downsample the Temporal Activation LSQ parameters for sampling with fewer steps.

```python
python3 quant_scripts/downsample_talsq_ckpt.py
```

### Step 8: Sample with the EfficientDM Model

```python
python3 quant_scripts/sample_lora_intmodel.py
```
