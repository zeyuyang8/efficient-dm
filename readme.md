# Efficient Diffusion Models

## Setup

In a Linux system, we can create a new environment using the following command:

```bash
conda env create -f environment.yaml
```

If we already have an environment and want to update it, we can use the following commands:

```bash
source deactivate
conda env update -f environment.yaml --prune
```
